## The mobject-disposable Library

This is one of the many libraries of [mobject](http://mobject.org). This library focuses on the handling of disposing dynamic objects.

## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.

## Why use mobject-disposable?

The mobject-disposable library provides a consistent way to handle the lifecycle of objects in an industrial control system. It includes an abstract class Disposable and an interface I_Disposable that can be implemented by classes that need to handle the deletion of objects.

The I_Disposable interface provides a common interface for objects that have a responsibility to delete others. This makes it easy to manage the lifecycle of objects in a complex system.

Overall, the mobject-disposable library helps to improve the reliability and maintainability of industrial control systems by providing a consistent way to handle the deletion of objects.
